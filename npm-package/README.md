# mychart-connector

Programmatic access to Epic MyChart patient portals from Node.js. Log in,
fetch every section of a patient's chart, and act on it (request refills,
send messages, manage emergency contacts) — all running locally in your
process.

This is the same scraper engine that powers
[openrecord.fanpierlabs.com](https://openrecord.fanpierlabs.com), packaged
for you to embed in your own integration.

📖 **Full API reference:** [docs.md](./docs.md) — every `MyChartClient`
method, raw scraper function, and exported type with signatures and
return shapes.

## Install

```bash
npm install mychart-connector
```

The package installs a CLI binary at `node_modules/.bin/mychart-connector`
(use it via `npx mychart-connector …`). You only run the CLI once, to set
up a passkey — see Quick start.

## Quick start

The recommended setup flow is **one-shot interactive**: register a
passkey via the CLI, save it, and from then on log in from code with no
prompts.

### 1. Register a passkey

Run the bundled CLI once:

```bash
npx mychart-connector --set-up-passkey --host mychart.example.org
```

The CLI walks you through username + password + 2FA, registers a new
passkey on your MyChart account (the same WebAuthn flow the official
MyChart app uses), and writes the credential to:

```
./.passkey-credentials/mychart.example.org.json
```

### 2. Add the credentials directory to `.gitignore`

```
echo '.passkey-credentials/' >> .gitignore
```

The file contains a private key — never commit it.

### 3. Use the passkey from your code

```ts
import {
  MyChartClient,
  deserializeCredential,
  serializeCredential,
} from 'mychart-connector';
import * as fs from 'node:fs/promises';

const path = './.passkey-credentials/mychart.example.org.json';
const credential = deserializeCredential(await fs.readFile(path, 'utf8'));

const result = await MyChartClient.connectWithPasskey({
  hostname: 'mychart.example.org',
  credential,
});
if (result.state !== 'connected') throw new Error('passkey login failed');
const client = result.client;

const meds = await client.getMedications();
console.log(meds);

client.close();

// IMPORTANT — see Authentication section below.
await fs.writeFile(path, serializeCredential(credential));
```

That's it. No more 2FA codes, no more prompts. Re-run the CLI's
`--set-up-passkey` only if you want to register a new passkey (e.g.
because you cleared the stored one).

For the full list of methods on `client`, see [docs.md](./docs.md).

## Authentication

Passkey-based login is the **recommended** auth flow for this package
because it's the only one that runs end-to-end without a human typing
in a 2FA code on every login. After the one-shot CLI setup above,
`MyChartClient.connectWithPasskey` is non-interactive and bypasses 2FA.

### `signCount` — must be persisted after every login

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A passkey credential is **not a static key**. Its `signCount` increments
> every time you log in. WebAuthn requires the counter to monotonically
> increase across logins; if you replay the *same* credential bytes twice,
> MyChart will reject the second attempt as a possible cloned authenticator.
>
> After every successful `connectWithPasskey` call you **must** re-serialize
> the credential and overwrite the file on disk. The Quick-start example
> above does exactly this.
>
> Concretely: load → use → re-save. Don't bake the passkey into a Docker
> image, a `process.env`, or anything else immutable. Treat it like a
> rotating session token that you persist back after every use.

### Other auth options

If a passkey doesn't fit your use case, the package also exposes:

- **Username + password + 2FA** — `MyChartClient.connect({ hostname, user, pass })`.
  Returns `{ state: 'connected', client }` for instances without 2FA, or
  `{ state: 'need_2fa', complete, delivery, sentAt }` when MyChart sent a
  code. Call `await pending.complete(code)` to finish.
- **TOTP** — if the user has an authenticator app set up, derive the code
  with `MyChartClient.totpCode(secret)` and pass `{ isTOTP: true }` to
  `pending.complete`.
- **Restored sessions** — `MyChartClient.fromSerialized(json)` rehydrates
  a previously-`serialize()`d session without re-logging-in. Handy when
  you want to dispatch from a queue and don't want to keep re-authing.

All of these still ultimately depend on either a human typing a code or
a saved TOTP secret, so prefer passkeys for unattended automation. See
[docs.md](./docs.md) for the full signatures.

## CLI reference

```
npx mychart-connector --host <hostname> [flags]
```

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--host <hostname>` | MyChart instance hostname. Required. |
| `--user <username>` | Skip the username prompt. |
| `--pass <password>` | Skip the password prompt. |
| `--2fa <code>` | Skip the 2FA prompt; use this code directly. |
| `--set-up-passkey` | Register a new passkey on the account, save it under `./.passkey-credentials/<host>.json`. **Run this once.** |
| `--use-passkey` | Log in with a previously-saved passkey instead of password+2FA. |
| `--list-passkeys` | After login, print all passkeys registered on the account. |
| `--delete-passkey` | Interactively delete a passkey by `rawId`. |
| `--set-up-totp` | Register a TOTP authenticator on the account, save the secret to `./.totp-secrets/<host>.txt`. |
| `--use-saved-totp` | Use the saved TOTP secret to derive 2FA codes (no prompt). |
| `--disable-totp` | Disable TOTP on the account. |
| `--no-cache` | Don't reuse cached cookies; force a fresh login. |
| `--action <name>` | Run a one-shot action: `send-message`, `send-reply`, `get-imaging`. |
| `--resend-2fa` | Pull the 2FA code from a Resend mailbox (Fan Pier Labs internal — requires `resend` and `@aws-sdk/client-secrets-manager` to be installed). |

The default invocation (no flags besides `--host`) logs in interactively
and dumps every scrape category to stdout. Useful as a smoke test.

The CLI stores credentials under `./.passkey-credentials/` and
`./.totp-secrets/` (both relative to the cwd). Override either with
`MYCHART_PASSKEY_DIR=/abs/path` or `MYCHART_TOTP_DIR=/abs/path`.

## Persisting sessions

Cookie-based sessions are short-lived (MyChart times them out after
~15 min of idle), but you can still skip a re-login between processes
by serializing the active session and rehydrating it later:

```ts
const json = await client.serialize();
await fs.writeFile('session.json', json);

// ...later, in another process
const restored = await MyChartClient.fromSerialized(await fs.readFile('session.json', 'utf8'));
if (await restored.isSessionValid()) {
  const meds = await restored.getMedications();
}
```

For longer-lived persistence (across sleep, across days), prefer the
passkey flow — re-running `connectWithPasskey` is fast and the
credential survives indefinitely as long as you re-save the mutated
copy after each login.

## Telemetry

This package sends anonymous usage events (think: Next.js / Vercel CLI
telemetry) so we can see which scrapers are actually exercised in the
wild and prioritize fixes accordingly.

What is collected:

- The event name (e.g. `scraper_login_started`) and the MyChart hostname
  the call targeted (the portal domain — not your machine's hostname).
- OS platform, architecture, OS version, and runtime version (e.g.
  `bun 1.3.9` or `node v22.11.0`).
- A stable random UUID generated once per project install and cached
  at `<your-project>/node_modules/.cache/mychart-connector/anonymous-id`
  (same convention Babel / ESLint / Webpack use). Used purely for
  dedupe. Never written outside `node_modules`. Cleared whenever you
  reinstall.

What is **not** collected: your public IP, OS hostname, OS username,
git config (`user.name` / `user.email`), or any data scraped from your
chart.

To disable telemetry entirely, set:

```bash
export MYCHART_CONNECTOR_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```
